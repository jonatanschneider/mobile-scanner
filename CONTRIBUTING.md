# How to contribute

This project is due to the 'Projektwoche' at THM in SoSe 18, from May 28th until June 1st. If you want to contribute, 
please contact one of our team members. 

> For contact information, see [AUTHORS.md](AUTHORS.md)

## Horizon

This project is meant to build a ebay-like clone. A seller will be able to sell products via an auction, which 
customers are able to place bids on.

For more information, see our [README.md](README.md).

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [THM Gitlab account](https://git.thm.de/).
* Submit an issue for every task if it does not already exist.
* Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.

## Making changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
    * This should always be the master branch, unless something went terribly wrong.
    * Use tags to describe your issue/branch/merge request.
    * Always provide information on what you are working on.
    * To quickly create a topic branch, go to your issue, expand `Create a merge request` and select `Create branch`.
* Make commits of logical and atomic units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespaces with `git diff --check` before commiting.
* Create tests for your changes, if possible (yes, it takes time, it is annoying, but also it is **necassary**)
* Run *all* tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.
* When creating new components/services/guards/interceptors/..., please stick to the conventions named in our 
[Wiki](https://git.thm.de/ekpf11/wbs-projekt/wikis/Angular-Conventions)

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in the repository.
* Check whether your topic branch is up to date with `master`. If not, please rebase your branch.
* Submit a merge request to the repository.
* Provide information about what changed.
* Mark you merge request with `ready for testing` when you finished your work. If you haven't already, mark it with `work in progress` and add `[WIP]: ` to the merge request's title.
* The team will then test your changes. When everything is as expected, your merge request will be marked as `ready for review`
* The scrum master will then check your code for style and compatibility. If everything is okay, your changes will be merged.
* If something goes wrong - do not panic! There will be a change request with more information about what went wrong. You can fix these problems, your merge request will remain open.

## Merge Requests

Merge Requests should have a meaningful title and description. Describe 

* what the issue was (briefly) or what the bug was (briefly)
* how to reconstruate the situation, the issue is linked to
* what the previous behaviour was
* what the expected behaviour is

The description should match the standards in commit messages all over all.

* Use `ready for testing` to mark your merge request as done. Another team member should then checkout this branch and 
test all changes. Please provide a meaningful description to help them review your work. Test for all possibilities and 
eventualities, as far as possible. Test beyond the expected behaviour.
* When you are ready with testing, mark the merge request as `ready for review`. This tag tells the other team members 
that the merge request should (in best case) be bug free. The team members will then make a code review where they 
check whether or not the naming conventions are observed etc.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense (`Add feature` instead of `Added feature`).
* Use the imperative mood (`Move cursor to...`instead of `Moves cursor to...`).
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
* Reference issues and merge requests liberally after the first line.

### Branch names

Branch names are found after the following rules:

issue-id-user-story-name-issue-name

E.g. `21-login-screen-project-setup`

They are automatically generated by pressing `Create branch` under the arrow in `Create Merge Request` on the issue 
page.
